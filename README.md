# ExperienceKeepInventory

## Description

A simple plugin that changes the way the keepInventory gamerule works.  
  
**ATTENTION:** keepInventory must be set to true for the plugin to work  
  
You can use the `/expcheck` command to check whether you have enough EXP to keep all your items if you die. The number of experience points should outweigh the total number of items in your inventory. If the player does not have enough EXP, all items will be dropped as normal.
